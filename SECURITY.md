Open Source Infrastructure (as Code) exposes identifying information that would not be exposed in a traditional
private organization to share knowledge and best practices. This is a net positive for
the community, but it does come with some risks.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Privately discuss, fix, and publish information about security vulnerabilities in this repository by drafting a new
[security advisory](https://github.com/osinfra-io/github-organization-management/security/advisories/new).
