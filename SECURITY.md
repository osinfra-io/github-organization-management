Open Source Infrastructure (as Code) exposes identifying information that would not be exposed in a traditional 
private organization in an effort to share knowledge and best practices. We believe that this is a net positive for
the community, but it does come with some risks. 

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Privately discuss, fix, and publish information about security vulnerabilities in this repository by drafting a new 
[security advisory](https://github.com/osinfra-io/github-organization-management/security/advisories/new).
